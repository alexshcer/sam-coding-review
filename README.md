# sam-coding-review
Welcome to the first Samuel Miller reviews your stupid code. In this form you will find just one coding question/challenge, and you will have to answer it with a link to a GitHub repo where your code will be posted. BE CREATIVE, BE FUNNY, BE A NOOB! The funnier and shittier the code is, the bigger the possibility to appear in the video. You can use any language you want.
